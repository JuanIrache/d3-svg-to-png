# d3-svg-to-png

Converts SVG elements in the browser to PNG and other image formats, while keeping CSS styles. Optionally, it returns the data as a promise or downloads it. It can also rescale the svg image, ignore certain DOM elements...

## Installation

```shell
$ npm i d3-svg-to-png
```

## Usage

```js
const d3ToPng = require('d3-svg-to-png');
d3ToPng('selector', 'name');
```

## Mandatory fields

- **Selector** (String): Commonly 'svg' or DOM Element.
- **Name** (String): Name for the file output, without extension.

Output: **name.png**

## Options

```js
const d3ToPng = require('d3-svg-to-png');
d3ToPng('svg', 'name', {
  scale: 3,
  format: 'webp',
  quality: 0.01,
  download: false,
  ignore: '.ignored',
  background: 'white'
}).then(fileData => {
  //do something with the data
});
```

## Notes

Please report any problem, as this has not been thoroughly tested and could be improved.
This module works outside of D3. It was created for the [GoPro Telemetry Extractor](https://goprotelemetryextractor.com)

## Contribution

Please make your changes to the **dev** branch, so that automated tests can be run before merging to **master**. Also, if possible, provide tests for new functionality.

## TODO
